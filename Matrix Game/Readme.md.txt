Name of the project : DoodleJump
Description :
In DoodleJump, the aim is to guide a stick-creature named "Doodler" up a never-ending series of 
platforms without falling. The left side of the playing field is connected with the right side.
The movement is being done by using the joystick to control the creature to the left or right and
a button to shoot projectiles.
Players can get short boosts/extra lives/different powers from various objects.
There are also monsters that the Doodler must avoid, shoot, or jump on to eliminate.
